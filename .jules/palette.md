## Optimization: Professionalized Empty State (No Products/Search Found)
- **Problem:** The previous "No products found" state was a simple text message, which looked unprofessional and provided no guidance for the user.
- **Solution:**
    - Introduced a specialized `.empty-state-professional` CSS class to create centered, visually appealing empty states.
    - Added high-quality SVG icons (search and box icons) to the empty states.
    - Included "Reset Filters" and "Go to Homepage" buttons in the empty states to provide clear next steps for the user.
    - Updated messaging from simple "No products found" to "No matching products found" with more descriptive subtext.
- **Impact:** Significant improvement in the visual quality of the application and better UX for users who find no results.
- **Accessibility:** Used semantic HTML and ensured descriptive text accompanies the icons.
- **Measurement Verification:** Playwright screenshots (e.g., `2_no_products_found.png`) confirmed the improved layout and icon presence.
## 2026-04-30 - Amazon-Style Address Management
**Learning:** Providing a grid of 'small box' cards for address selection improves mobile usability compared to long lists or dropdowns.
**Action:** Implement grid-based card layouts for management interfaces to maximize screen real estate and improve touch targets.

## 2024-06-08 - Accessible Icon Buttons & Clipboard UX
**Learning:** Icon-only interactive elements must be semantic `<button>` elements with `aria-label` to be keyboard and screen reader accessible. Providing instant visual feedback (like "✅ Copied!") on the button itself significantly improves the perceived responsiveness of clipboard operations.
**Action:** Standardize all icon-only interactions as buttons with ARIA labels and use the `bzCopyText` helper for copy interactions.
