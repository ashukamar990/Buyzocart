## Optimization: Professionalized Empty State (No Products/Search Found)
- **Problem:** The previous "No products found" state was a simple text message, which looked unprofessional and provided no guidance for the user.
- **Solution:**
    - Introduced a specialized `.empty-state-professional` CSS class to create centered, visually appealing empty states.
    - Added high-quality SVG icons (search and box icons) to the empty states.
    - Included "Reset Filters" and "Go to Homepage" buttons in the empty states to provide clear next steps for the user.
    - Updated messaging from simple "No products found" to "No matching products found" with more descriptive subtext.
- **Impact:** Significant improvement in the visual quality of the application and better UX for users who find no results.
- **Accessibility:** Used semantic HTML and ensured descriptive text accompanies the icons.
- **Measurement Verification:** Playwright screenshots (e.g., `2_no_products_found.png`) confirmed the improved layout and icon presence.
## 2026-04-30 - Amazon-Style Address Management
**Learning:** Providing a grid of 'small box' cards for address selection improves mobile usability compared to long lists or dropdowns.
**Action:** Implement grid-based card layouts for management interfaces to maximize screen real estate and improve touch targets.

## 2025-05-14 - Non-semantic Trigger Accessibility
**Learning:** The application frequently uses `div` elements as interactive triggers (e.g., mobile menu, social links). These are ignored by screen readers and keyboard-only users unless explicitly given `role="button"`, `tabindex="0"`, and `keydown` listeners.
**Action:** Always check for `onclick` handlers on non-button elements and ensure they have appropriate ARIA roles and keyboard activation support.
