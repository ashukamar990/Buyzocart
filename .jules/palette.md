## Optimization: Professionalized Empty State (No Products/Search Found)
- **Problem:** The previous "No products found" state was a simple text message, which looked unprofessional and provided no guidance for the user.
- **Solution:**
    - Introduced a specialized `.empty-state-professional` CSS class to create centered, visually appealing empty states.
    - Added high-quality SVG icons (search and box icons) to the empty states.
    - Included "Reset Filters" and "Go to Homepage" buttons in the empty states to provide clear next steps for the user.
    - Updated messaging from simple "No products found" to "No matching products found" with more descriptive subtext.
- **Impact:** Significant improvement in the visual quality of the application and better UX for users who find no results.
- **Accessibility:** Used semantic HTML and ensured descriptive text accompanies the icons.
- **Measurement Verification:** Playwright screenshots (e.g., `2_no_products_found.png`) confirmed the improved layout and icon presence.

**Learning:** Providing a grid of 'small box' cards for address selection improves mobile usability compared to long lists or dropdowns.
**Action:** Implement grid-based card layouts for management interfaces to maximize screen real estate and improve touch targets.

## 2026-05-15 - Boundary Enforcement for Quantity Selectors
**Learning:** Preventing invalid user input through proactive boundary enforcement (disabling buttons) is superior to reactive feedback (toasts) as it reduces cognitive load and prevents "error-state" frustration. Standardizing these inputs with ARIA labels and semantic types ensures accessibility for screen readers while maintaining a consistent visual language.
**Action:** Always pair numerical inputs with state-aware control buttons and use CSS ':disabled' states to provide immediate visual cues for interface limits.
