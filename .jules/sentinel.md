## Optimization: Robust Storage Parsing and Error Handling
- **Problem:** Brittle `localStorage` parsing could lead to application-wide crashes if the user's data became corrupted or malformed.
- **Solution:**
    - Implemented a robust `try-catch` wrapper for `localStorage.getItem` and `JSON.parse` in `cacheManager.get`.
    - Added structural validation to ensure that cached objects contain a 'data' property and that critical keys (products, categories, banners) are arrays before use.
    - Implemented `try-catch` in product rendering loops (`renderProducts`, `renderSearchResults`) to ensure that a single malformed product does not crash the entire grid.
- **Impact:** Hardens the application against local data corruption and ensures that malformed data from the backend or the user's local environment does not break the user experience.
- **Security Improvement:** Prevents unexpected application behavior or crashes that could potentially be exploited through local data manipulation.
- **Measurement Verification:** Playwright tests confirmed that injecting corrupted JSON into `localStorage` (e.g., `invalid json {[` ) no longer crashes the site and still allows the application to load data from the network.
